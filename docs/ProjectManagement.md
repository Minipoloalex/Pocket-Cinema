# Iteration planning and Retrospectives

## Retrospective **#0**

### Positive Aspects

- Implementation velocity above expectations.

### What can be better

- Don't merge PRs without them being reviewed by at least one team member other than the author.
- Define new issues as fast as possible.


### Puzzles

- Google authentication is still a mystery to us.
- Uncertainty about the movies/shows API.
